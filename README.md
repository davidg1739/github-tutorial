_**Pictures are property of Git and Github**_  

[**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) was initially released on _April 7, 2005_ by its creator _Linus Torvalds_. It is a service that manages multiple versions of `code`. Any directory with git in it is a repository. Any git repository can be uploaded to github. [**Github**](https://github.com) was initially released on _April 10, 2008_ by its creator _Tom Preston-Werner_. It is a cloud drive where you can repositories live. Git does **not** need Github to work.
